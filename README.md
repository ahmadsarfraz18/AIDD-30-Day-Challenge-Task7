AI-Driven Development – 30 Day Challenge (Task 7)
Spec+ / SpecPlus Overview
📘 Definition: SpecPlus (SpecKit Plus)

SpecPlus is a tool that helps teams clearly define project requirements, plan the structure, and break down tasks.
It ensures that every part of the project is well-documented and easy to follow for developers and agents.

🔍 Simple Example

“When I was in class 10, our teacher made a team of 5 students and gave each person one part of the project.”

This shows how clear instructions and task distribution make projects easier and more successful.

🏛️ Project Constitution (Team Rules & Principles)
🎯 Purpose

The Constitution sets the global rules and standards that guide the entire project from start to finish.
It ensures every team member works with discipline, quality, and consistency.

📌 Core Principles

Clean Code: Write simple, readable, and well-tested code.

OOP / Modular Design: Keep your code organized and well-structured.

Privacy & Security: Protect user information and follow secure practices.

Testing / TDD: Build tests and follow test-driven development for quality.

Documentation: Maintain updated and accurate documentation (e.g., Docusaurus).

⚙️ Five-Step Workflow (with / prefix)

These five steps guide the complete development journey — from rules to planning to implementation.

/Constitution

This step defines how the project should be handled by the team, including rules, behavior, coding style, and communication standards.
It acts like a guidebook that all team members must follow throughout the project.

/Specify

This step explains exactly what the project needs to include, such as features, requirements, and goals.
It makes sure everyone clearly understands what success looks like and what must be delivered.

/Plan

This step creates the full structural plan of the project, including architecture, tools, workflow, and timelines.
It helps the team understand how the project will be built and which technologies or methods will be used.

/Tasks

This step breaks the project into small, manageable chunks of work that can be assigned individually.
It helps distribute responsibilities so that the team can work efficiently and avoid confusion.

/Implement

This step is where the actual development begins — coding, researching, testing, and building features.
Each team member works on their assigned tasks, gradually turning the plan into a working project.
