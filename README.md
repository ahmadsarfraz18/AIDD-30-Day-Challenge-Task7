AI-Driven Development – 30 Day Challenge
Task 7
(Spec+ / SpecPlus)
Definition: (SpecKit Plus) a specification augmentation tool to formally capture project requirements, plans, and tasks for the CLI/agent ecosystem.
Example Use-Case (simple learning analogy):
"When I was in class 10, our teacher formed teams of 5, and each student was given a specific part of a project."
This illustrates how specification + task division leads to measurable outcomes.
Project Constitution (Global Principles & Rules)
Purpose: The Constitution captures project-level, static rules and principles that all team members must follow.
Core Principles:
•	Clean Code: Maintain readable, tested, and well-documented code.
•	OOP / Modular Design: Prefer object-oriented or modular designs where appropriate.
•	Privacy & Security: Respect user data privacy and follow security best practices.
•	Testing & TDD: Encourage test-driven development and automated tests.
•	Documentation: Keep end-user and developer documentation in sync (Docusaurus).


Five-Step Workflow & Prompt Commands
These are CLI-style prompts intended to guide project setup and execution.
1.	 /constitution:
Purpose: Print or show project rules and constitutional principles.
Use: /sp.constitution displays global rules, coding standards, and team norms.
Example: Creating a WhatsApp group for the team and allowing only approved behaviours recorded as part of the Constitution.
2.	 /specify:
Purpose: Collect and write down clear project requirements and acceptance criteria.
Use: /sp.specify document “what we want” and “what success looks like.”
Example: Mapping assigned tasks to concrete deliverables and feature requirements.
3.	 /plan:
Purpose: Create the project’s overall plan, architecture, tech choices, and timeline.
Use: /sp.plan outlines structure, tools, and deadlines.
Example: Decomposing the project into milestones with estimated days per milestone.
4.	 /tasks:
Purpose: Break the plan into concrete, small tasks and assign them.
Use: /sp.tasks returns a task board or to-do list with assignees and status.
Example: Splitting a single assignment into five sub-tasks and assigning to team members.
5.	 /implement:
Purpose: Kick off development once planning and task allocation are complete.
Use: /sp.implement start build pipelines, run CI, and begin implementation per tasks.
Example: Team members do their research, start coding, and submit PRs.
